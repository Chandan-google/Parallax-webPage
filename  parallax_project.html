            <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Biking, also known as cycling, is a popular form of transportation,
            exercise, and recreation that involves riding a bicycle.
            A bicycle is a two-wheeled vehicle propelled by pedals, powered by the rider's legs.

            Biking can be done on a variety of terrains, including roads, trails, mountains,
            and urban areas. It can be done alone or in groups, competitively or leisurely.
            Biking is a low-impact form of exercise that can help improve cardiovascular 
            health, build endurance, and strengthen muscles in the legs, back, and core.

            Bikes come in a variety of styles, including road bikes,
            mountain bikes, hybrid bikes, and commuter bikes. 
            Road bikes are designed for speed and efficiency on paved surfaces, 
            while mountain bikes are built to handle rough terrain and off-road trails.
            Hybrid bikes combine features of both road and mountain bikes and 
            are versatile for a variety of riding conditions. Commuter bikes are designed 
            for everyday transportation, with features such as racks, fenders, and lights.

            Biking is a popular activity around the world, with many communities 
            promoting it as a sustainable and healthy mode of transportation.
            It can be enjoyed alone or with friends and family, and can provide a sense of
            freedom and adventure as one explores new places and experiences the 
            world from a different perspective.

            <h2 class="description">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Paragliding is a thrilling adventure sport that involves flying through
            the air using a canopy wing and a harness. The canopy wing is made of 
            lightweight fabric and is inflated by the wind, providing lift and 
            allowing the paraglider to soar through the sky.

            Paragliding is typically done from a high point, such as a hill or 
            mountain, and the launch involves running or jumping off the edge of the slope. 
            Once airborne, the paraglider uses the wind and thermals to stay aloft and can 
            glide for long distances and at varying altitudes.

            The sport requires some training and equipment, including a paraglider wing, 
            harness, helmet, and other safety gear. Experienced paragliders often use 
            a variometer to measure the rate of climb and descent, as well as 
            GPS devices to track their location and progress.

            Paragliding is a popular activity around the world and can be enjoyed in a 
            variety of settings, from mountainous regions to coastal areas. 
            It offers a unique perspective on the world and allows participants to 
            experience the thrill of free flight. Paragliding is also a competitive sport, 
            with events and competitions held around the world, including distance races, 
            aerobatic competitions, and cross-country events.

            <h2 class="description">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Surfing is a water sport that involves riding waves using a surfboard. 
            Surfers paddle out into the ocean and wait for a wave to come, 
            then use their skills to catch and ride the wave back to shore.

            Surfboards come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from longboards to shortboards, 
            and are made of foam or fiberglass. They are designed to be buoyant and 
            maneuverable in the water, allowing surfers to carve turns and ride the waves in style.

            Surfing requires strength, balance, and agility, as well as an understanding 
            of ocean conditions and wave patterns. It is a popular activity around the world 
            and is enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.

            Surfing culture has its own language and traditions, with a focus on respect 
            for the ocean and other surfers. Surfers often gather in groups to share tips 
            and stories, and many communities have their own surf spots and events.

            Surfing can be a thrilling and challenging activity, offering a unique 
            connection to nature and the ocean. It can also provide a sense of peace 
            and tranquility as one rides the waves and enjoys the beauty of the ocean.
